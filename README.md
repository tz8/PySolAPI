# PySolAPI

This project is using the logic of the original [SolXpect](https://github.com/woheller69/solxpect) source code from [Dr. Heller](https://github.com/woheller69) and its nodejs implementation as [SolAPI](https://github.com/nick81nrw/solApi). The forecast logic is refactored to Python with the aim to make it easily deployable to an Azure App Service.

Currently the service listens to POST requests against /forecast, the body of the request should look like the content of the POST_body_example.json file. As you can see, you can define infinite inverters with multiple strings per inverter. The API logic will cycle through this and return a combined result for the whole batch. Due to the used [weather model from open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/ensemble-api?models=icon_d2&hourly=temperature_2m,shortwave_radiation,diffuse_radiation,direct_normal_irradiance&tilt=30&azimuth=42&past_days=1#data_sources) the APIs usability is restricted to Central Europe, locations outside of it won't get proper results. Have fun!
