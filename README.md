# PySolAPI

This project is using the logic of the original [SolXpect](https://github.com/woheller69/solxpect) source code from [Dr. Heller](https://github.com/woheller69) and its nodejs implementation as [SolAPI](https://github.com/nick81nrw/solApi). Everything is refactored to Python with the aim to make it easily deployable to an Azure App Service.
